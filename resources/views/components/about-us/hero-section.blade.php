                        Being in the mail industry, we see first hand the mountains of junk mail that people
                        get everyday. Which prompted us to start digging into the impact of junk mail on our
                        planet.

                        We were shocked to find that of the 5,600,000 lbs of junk mail is printed every year,
                        less than a quarter of it is recycled. Which means 4.3 Million lbs of junk mail ends up
                        in America's landfills every year.
