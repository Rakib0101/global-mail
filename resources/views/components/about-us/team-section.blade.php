                            Our Mission is to give everyone a permanent address in the cloud. The one address that
                            people will use for the rest of their lives- on their drivers license, passports, to receive
                            mail, no matter how many homes they live in. And to digitize all postal mail for companies
                            to make it effortlessly accessible on demand.
