                        An average American spends 32 weeks of their life sorting through
                        junk mail! And a 100 Million trees are cut each year to print junk mail.
                        We want to change that. We want to reclaim the 32 weeks back for
                        ourselves and for you. And plant a 100 Million trees to reduce the
                        forest debt that junk mail creates.

                        We shred and recycle all junk and discarded mail for our members.
                        But that's not enough. Our dream is to recycle ALL the junk mail that
                        gets printed. All 5.6 Million Pounds of it. Because that would mean we
                        not only help recycle millions of tons of junk mail that otherwise
                        would not get recycled but we also reduce the number of garbage
                        trucks on our streets that transport this junk mail – 340,000 trucks
                        every year by some estimates.

                        a 100,000,000 trees. Deforestation accounts for almost 20% of the
                        worlds carbon footprint.

                        We decided to not only neutralize the carbon foot print for our
                        members, but actually reverse it. So for each user, we plant a tree to
                        compensate for the junk mail created for them. Are you ready to join
                        the movement?
